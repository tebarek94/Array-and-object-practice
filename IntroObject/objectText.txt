Key Points:
Object jonas:

An object is defined with properties: firstName, lastName, age, job, and friends.
Properties can be accessed using dot notation (.) or bracket notation ([]).
Dot Notation vs. Bracket Notation:

Dot notation (jonas.lastName) is used for properties with fixed names.
Bracket notation (jonas['lastName']) allows for dynamic access and is useful for property names that are not valid identifiers or are determined at runtime.
Dynamic Property Access:

Properties can be accessed dynamically using concatenation of strings (e.g., jonas['first' + nameKey]).
User Input:

The prompt function asks the user for input on which property they want to know about.
The code checks if the input property exists in the jonas object and displays its value. If the property does not exist, it displays "Not Found.
